4. Make a new application (if you don't have one)
5. Copy the Application ID
6. Replace <Required> field of the ClientID
7. Replace <Required> field of the State with any thing you want (for example: Testing pyrp)

9. Run executable
```

## Planned content
* At the moment, I'm trying to implement [pypresence](https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence) to Adobe suite and any programs I often use.
* Add more spur-of-the-moment ideas.
